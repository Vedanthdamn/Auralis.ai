```

**Fields:**
- `driver_id`: Driver identifier
- `driver_name`: Driver's full name
- `feedback`: AI-generated natural language feedback
- `score`: Current average safety score
- `timestamp`: ISO timestamp when feedback was generated

## AI Model Configuration

### Mistral Model Selection
The API uses Ollama with the following model priority:

1. **Primary Model**: `mistral:7b-instruct-q4_0`
   - Quantized 4-bit version (~4.1 GB)
   - Optimized for instruction following
   - Best balance of quality and performance

2. **Fallback Model**: `mistral:latest`
   - Latest stable Mistral release
   - Falls back if q4_0 variant not available

3. **Final Fallback**: `mistral`
   - Generic Mistral model tag
   - Catches any available Mistral variant

If all Ollama models fail, the system falls back to rule-based feedback generation.

**Note**: Model digests (e.g., b17615239298) may vary based on your Ollama installation. The system automatically uses whichever variant is available from the priority list above.

### Rule-Based Fallback
When AI models are unavailable, the system generates feedback using:
- Score thresholds (Excellent: >=8, Good: 6-7.9, Fair: 4-5.9, Poor: <4)
- Specific metrics analysis (speed, braking, acceleration)
- Performance trends (improvement, consistency)

## Data Aggregation

### Driver Statistics
Driver statistics are computed from raw driving events:
- **Average Score**: Mean of all event scores
- **Trip Count**: Number of distinct driving sessions
- **Best/Worst Score**: Maximum and minimum scores achieved
- **Average Metrics**: Mean speed, acceleration, and braking intensity
- **Last Trip**: Most recent session timestamp

### Fleet Summary
Fleet-level metrics aggregate across all drivers:
- **Fleet Average**: Mean of all driver averages
- **Performance Categories**: Drivers grouped by score ranges
- **Top Performers**: Safest driver and most improved driver

## Database Support

### Supabase Integration
When configured, the API queries:
- `drivers` table: Driver profiles
- `sessions` table: Driving sessions
- `events` table: Real-time driving events
- `driver_stats` view: Pre-computed statistics (if available)

### Mock Data Fallback
When Supabase is not configured, the API returns sample data for:
- 5 sample drivers with varied performance levels
- Realistic metrics and scores
- Proper data structure for frontend compatibility

This allows frontend development and testing without database setup.

## Frontend Integration

### React Component Usage
The API is designed for seamless integration with React components:

```javascript
// Fleet Summary
const summaryResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/summary')
const summary = await summaryResponse.json()
// Use with FleetStats component

// Driver List
const driversResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/drivers')
const { drivers } = await driversResponse.json()
// Use with DriverRankings and DriverCard components

// Fleet Insights
const insightsResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/insights')
const { insights } = await insightsResponse.json()
// Use with FleetInsights component

// Individual Driver Feedback
const feedbackResponse = await fetch(
  `http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/drivers/${driverId}/feedback`,
  { method: 'POST' }
)
const feedback = await feedbackResponse.json()
// Display in DriverCard expanded view
```

## Error Handling

### HTTP Status Codes
- `200 OK`: Successful response
- `404 Not Found`: Driver not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Database not configured (when mock data is disabled)

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "detail": "Error message description"
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
Use the provided test script:
```bash
cd /tmp
./test_fleet_api.sh
```

### Automated Validation
Run the Python validation script:
```bash
python /tmp/validate_fleet_api.py
```

### Expected Test Results
All endpoints should return:
- Status code 200
- Valid JSON response
- All expected fields present
- Reasonable data values

## Performance Considerations

### Response Times
- `/fleet/summary`: ~10-50ms
- `/fleet/drivers`: ~20-100ms (depends on driver count)
- `/fleet/insights`: ~100-500ms (includes AI generation)
- `/fleet/drivers/{id}/feedback`: ~100-500ms (includes AI generation)

### Optimization Tips
1. Use `include_feedback=false` for faster driver list responses
2. Cache fleet summary on frontend (refresh every 30-60 seconds)
3. Generate driver feedback on-demand (when card is expanded)
4. Use WebSocket for real-time score updates
