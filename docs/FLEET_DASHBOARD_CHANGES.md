# Fleet Dashboard API Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to implement comprehensive fleet dashboard functionality with AI-powered feedback using the Mistral 7B model.

## Changes Made

### 1. ML Service Enhancements (`backend/services/ml_service.py`)

#### Mistral Model Integration
- Updated `_generate_ollama_driver_feedback()` to use model priority:
  1. `mistral:7b-instruct-q4_0` - Primary model (quantized 4-bit, ~4.1 GB)
  2. `mistral:latest` - First fallback (latest stable release)
  3. `mistral` - Generic fallback
- Added robust error handling with automatic fallback between models
- Same model priority applied to `_generate_ollama_fleet_insights()`
- Maintains rule-based feedback generation as final fallback

Note: The model IDs (b17615239298, 6577803aa9a0) are example digests that may vary based on your Ollama installation. The system will automatically use whichever variant is available.

#### Key Features
- **Model Fallback**: Automatically tries multiple model variants
- **Error Resilience**: Continues working even if AI models unavailable
- **Logging**: Clear console output showing which model succeeded
- **Timeout Protection**: 15-second timeout prevents hanging requests

### 2. Supabase Service Enhancements (`backend/services/supabase_service.py`)

#### Enhanced Fleet Summary
Added performance categorization to `get_fleet_summary()`:
- `high_performers`: Drivers with avg_score >= 8.0
- `average_performers`: Drivers with avg_score 5.0-7.9
- `low_performers`: Drivers with avg_score < 5.0

Added most improved driver tracking:
- Calculates improvement based on best_score - worst_score difference
- Identifies driver with greatest improvement range

#### Return Format
```python
{
    'total_drivers': int,
    'total_trips': int,
    'fleet_avg_score': float,
    'safest_driver': str,
    'safest_driver_score': float,
    'most_improved_driver': str,
    'most_improved_score': float,
    'high_performers': int,
    'average_performers': int,
    'low_performers': int
}
```

### 3. API Routes Enhancements (`backend/app/routes.py`)

#### Updated Endpoints

**GET /api/fleet/summary**
- Returns comprehensive fleet statistics
- Includes performance categorization
- Provides mock data when database not configured
- All fields required by frontend components

**GET /api/fleet/drivers**
- Added optional `include_feedback` query parameter
- Generates AI feedback for all drivers when requested
- Returns properly ranked driver list
- Includes comprehensive driver statistics
- Provides mock data with 5 sample drivers when database not configured

**GET /api/fleet/insights**
- Generates AI-powered fleet-level insights
- Works with both real and mock data
- Uses updated Mistral model selection
- Returns insights with timestamp and summary

**POST /api/fleet/drivers/{driver_id}/feedback**
- Generates personalized AI feedback for individual drivers
- Works with mock data when database not configured
- Returns detailed feedback with driver context
- Includes score and timestamp

#### Mock Data Support
All fleet endpoints now provide realistic sample data when Supabase is not configured:
- 5 sample drivers with varied performance levels
- Realistic metrics (scores 5.9 to 9.2)
- Proper trip counts, dates, and driving metrics
- Enables frontend development without database setup

### 4. Documentation (`docs/FLEET_DASHBOARD_API.md`)

Created comprehensive API documentation including:
- Endpoint descriptions and examples
- Request/response formats
- AI model configuration details
- Data aggregation methods
- Frontend integration examples
- Testing procedures
- Performance considerations

## Testing Results

### API Endpoint Tests
All fleet endpoints tested and passing:
- ✅ GET /api/fleet/summary - Returns all required fields
- ✅ GET /api/fleet/drivers - Returns ranked driver list
- ✅ GET /api/fleet/insights - Generates AI insights
- ✅ POST /api/fleet/drivers/{id}/feedback - Generates driver feedback

### Personal Dashboard Tests
All existing endpoints still working:
- ✅ GET /health - Service health check
- ✅ GET / - Root endpoint
- ✅ POST /api/driving_data - Score calculation
- ✅ GET /api/current_score - Current score retrieval

### Validation Results
```
Tests Passed: 4/4
✅ All tests passed!
```

## Frontend Compatibility

### Data Format Compatibility
All API responses match expected frontend component formats:

**FleetStats Component**: ✅ Compatible
- Receives: total_drivers, total_trips, fleet_avg_score, safest_driver, safest_driver_score

**DriverRankings Component**: ✅ Compatible  
- Receives: drivers array with rank, driver_id, driver_name, avg_score, trip_count

**FleetInsights Component**: ✅ Compatible
- Receives: insights, timestamp, fleet_summary with performance categories

**DriverCard Component**: ✅ Compatible
- Receives: driver data with all metrics, fetches feedback on demand

### API URLs
All frontend components use correct API endpoints:
- `http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/summary`
- `http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/drivers`
- `http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/insights`
- `http://localhost:8000/api/fleet/drivers/{id}/feedback`
