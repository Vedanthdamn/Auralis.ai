## Technical Implementation Details

### AI Model Integration
```python
# Model priority chain
models_to_try = [
    "mistral:7b-instruct-q4_0",  # Primary (4.1 GB)
    "mistral:latest",             # Fallback 1
    "mistral"                     # Fallback 2
]

# Automatic fallback with logging
for model in models_to_try:
    try:
        response = requests.post(...)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"✅ Generated using model: {model}")
            return result
    except Exception:
        continue  # Try next model
```

### Performance Categorization
```python
high_performers = len([d for d in drivers if d['avg_score'] >= 8])
average_performers = len([d for d in drivers if 5 <= d['avg_score'] < 8])
low_performers = len([d for d in drivers if d['avg_score'] < 5])
```

### Most Improved Driver
```python
for driver in driver_stats:
    improvement = driver['best_score'] - driver['worst_score']
    if improvement > max_improvement:
        most_improved = driver
```

### Mock Data Fallback
```python
if not supabase_service.is_configured():
    return {
        "drivers": sample_drivers,  # 5 realistic samples
        "total_count": 5
    }
