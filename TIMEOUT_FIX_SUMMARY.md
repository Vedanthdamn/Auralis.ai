# HTTP Timeout Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The DriveMind.ai FastAPI backend and simulator were experiencing HTTP timeout errors when handling rapid POST requests, especially at 1-second intervals. The system needed to support separate personal and fleet simulation modes running concurrently without interference.

## Solution Overview
Implemented comprehensive improvements to the backend, simulator, and documentation to fix timeout errors and properly support concurrent simulations.

---

## 1. Backend Improvements

### A. Concurrency Control (backend/main.py)
```python
# Added semaphore for rate limiting
request_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS)  # 10 concurrent
```
- Limits concurrent requests to prevent backend overload
- Configurable via `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` constant
- Graceful degradation when limit is reached

### B. Partial Response Handling (backend/app/routes.py)
```python
try:
    async with asyncio.timeout(2.0):
        async with semaphore:
            score = ml_service.calculate_score(data)
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    # Return partial response with lower confidence
    return ScoreResponse(score=5.0, timestamp=datetime.utcnow(), confidence=0.5)
```
- Returns default score (5.0) when backend is too busy
- Lower confidence value (0.5) indicates partial response
- Prevents request failures due to overload

### C. Non-Blocking Operations
```python
# Use create_task for non-blocking broadcast and storage
asyncio.create_task(broadcast({...}))
asyncio.create_task(supabase_service.store_event(data, score))
```
- WebSocket broadcasting doesn't block request handling
- Database storage runs in background
- Improves response times significantly

### D. Session Tracking (backend/models/schemas.py)
```python
class DrivingData(BaseModel):
    ...
    session_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Session ID for tracking")
```
- Added `session_id` field to DrivingData model
- Enables filtering of updates by session
- Prevents cross-contamination between simulations

---

## 2. Simulator Improvements

### A. Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff (simulation/drive_simulator.py)
```python
def send_telemetry(self, telemetry: Dict, max_retries: int = 3) -> Optional[Dict]:
    retry_delays = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]  # Exponential backoff
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.post(..., timeout=10)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                return response.json()
            elif response.status_code == 503:
                # Backend busy, retry with delay
                time.sleep(retry_delays[attempt])
                continue
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            # Retry on timeout
            time.sleep(retry_delays[attempt])
            continue
```
- Automatic retry on connection errors and timeouts
- Exponential backoff: 0.5s ‚Üí 1.0s ‚Üí 2.0s
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Clear console feedback on retry status

### B. Session Management
```python
def __init__(self, api_url: str = "http://localhost:8000/api"):
    ...
    self.session_id = None
    self.session_scores = []  # Track scores for this session

def run_simulation(self, duration: int, update_interval: float, simulation_mode: str):
    import uuid
    self.session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())  # Unique ID per run
    self.session_scores = []
```
- Each simulation run gets unique UUID
- Tracks scores independently per session
- Displays session statistics at completion

### C. Enhanced Statistics Display
```python
# During simulation
avg_score = sum(self.session_scores) / len(self.session_scores)
print(f"Score: {score:4.1f}/10 | Avg: {avg_score:4.1f}/10 ‚úÖ")

# At completion
print(f"Session ID: {self.session_id}")
print(f"Total updates: {len(self.session_scores)}")
print(f"Average score: {sum(self.session_scores) / len(self.session_scores):.2f}/10")
print(f"Best score: {max(self.session_scores):.2f}/10")
print(f"Worst score: {min(self.session_scores):.2f}/10")
```

### D. Increased Timeout
- Request timeout increased from 5s to 10s
- Handles slower networks and busy backends
- Still fast enough for real-time operation

## 5. Usage Examples

### Running Concurrent Simulations
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Terminal 2: Personal Simulation
cd simulation
python drive_simulator.py --duration 300 --interval 1.0 --mode personal

# Terminal 3: Fleet Simulation
cd simulation
python drive_simulator.py --duration 300 --interval 1.0 --mode fleet
```

### Console Output Example
```
üöó [PERSONAL] Speed:  60.5 km/h | Accel:  0.50 m/s¬≤ | Brake: 0.00 | Steer:  5.2¬∞ | Scenario: normal     | Score:  8.5/10 | Avg:  8.3/10 ‚úÖ

==================================================
‚úÖ PERSONAL Simulation complete!
Session ID: 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
Total updates: 42
Average score: 8.34/10
Best score: 9.50/10
Worst score: 6.20/10
```

### Retry Mechanism in Action
```
‚è≥ Request timeout, retrying in 0.5s (attempt 1/3)...
‚è≥ Request timeout, retrying in 1.0s (attempt 2/3)...
‚úÖ Request successful after retry
```

---

## 6. Configuration Options

### Backend Configuration (backend/main.py)
```python
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 10  # Adjust based on server capacity
```

### Simulator Configuration
```bash
python drive_simulator.py \
  --duration 300 \         # Simulation duration in seconds
  --interval 1.0 \         # Update interval (1.0s minimum recommended)
  --mode personal \        # Mode: personal or fleet
  --api-url http://localhost:8000/api  # Backend URL
```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### High Load Scenarios
If you see retry attempts:
1. Check backend CPU usage
2. Increase `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` if server can handle it
3. Reduce number of concurrent simulators
4. Increase `--interval` to reduce request frequency

### Partial Responses
If confidence < 0.95:
- Backend is temporarily overloaded
- Simulator continues with default score (5.0)
- Consider optimizations above
